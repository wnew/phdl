Python HDL

This is not my work, but I have taken the code from the Thesis write up and put it into GitHub for easy access.

This is all the work of Ali Mashtizadeh.

Abstract

This thesis presents PHDL, a new hardware design language (HDL). In PHDL digital
hardware components can vary in input/output widths, target platform, and have optional
inputs and outputs. PHDL enables developers to write software to make intelligent compile
time decisions far beyond the capabilities of current HDLs. The approach taken is to build
PHDL on the Python scripting language and to build a component library sufficiently large
to design a microprocessor. As an example a microprocessor is designed in PHDL to show
the practicality of the language. The example shows that on average designs can be written
with less complexity than a corresponding Verilog implementation, while achieving better
portability and platform specific optimizations.
